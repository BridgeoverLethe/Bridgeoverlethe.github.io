TLDR: Chat GPT responses have inherent unpredictability. To manage this, you need to understand it. For that you need ML/LLM Ops


At this point there are 3 groups of people: 
1) People who use Generative AI every day
2) People who are thinking of it
3) People who are tired of hearing about it

Dread it. Run from it. Gen AI talking points appear all the same. 

To avoid following the bandwagon, I've been spending the past several months working with LLMs. I've written summarizers, 



Going from PoC to production ready system though, that's not as easy.

I have been using Gen AI extensively since Chat GPT showed up. I regret not having taken a look at it sooner.

Similarly: 

"we were all hacking together at the AGI house which is a collective of a very talented AI researchers data scientists machine learning engineers and we all spent a Saturday trying to hack together um some cool projects all involving agents so for some contexts um we uh everyone on the team has tried agents and we've all come to the conclusion that they suck uh it's just
