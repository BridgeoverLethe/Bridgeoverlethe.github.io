The moment Chat GPT came out, and I got to use it beyond a point, I knew I wanted to create my own personal daemon. Secure, trained for my needs, and capable.

In the process of getting there, I have picked up VScode, Git, Astro (runs this blog), Langchain (powers my failures), Midjourney (happily consumes all my time), Figma (because why not add more tools) and Chat GPT (its like salt, used to flavor everything)

Eventually, I wanted to move away from reading papers (man can I talk my own ear off on these), and to actually using Generative AI as a first class tool for my life.

This website, is part of that process. Its existence, its colour schemes, code and my ability to make it were moved months, if not years ahead because of my use of Gen AI tools.

Story Time:

About a month ago, I was having trouble with prioritizing tasks. It was one of those weeks where it felt that you were not moving ahead, and you had a laundry list of tasks that needed to get done at the same time.

At this point I didn’t want some generic priority list. I wanted to have *clarity*. How should I prioritize life, work, career goals, wellness, mental wellbeing.

So I started up Chat GPT - I created a coach, guide, psychologist, and started to work on a personal profile of myself. A profile good enough, that I could get actually relevant advice.

The persona, on its own was ineffective. Till I created Two personas, with slightly different goals, and then I was cooking with fire.

That team worked so well, my next prompts are almost always teams of personas working on the same problem.

Well, thats enough for now, I should put this in a part two.

Let’s see if that obsidian publish tool really works now shall we..

After several hours:

- Ah yes, using "?" in titles makes obsidian upset.

Several more hours:
- And having your date variable set to Indian Standards makes obsidian-publisher upset.
- Not having your API key transfer to your other build is also fun.

Hello world.
