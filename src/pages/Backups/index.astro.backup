				<h1>Hi!</h1>
				<p>
					I'm Nikhil. I'd love to tell you who I am in a nutshell, but that covers:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Trust and Safety person</li>
					<li>Ex mod</li>
					<li>Data person</li>
					<li>Project manager</li>
					<li>Six Sigma survivor</li>
					<li>2008 financial <i>startup</i> veteran (Hey TVFS!)</li>
					<li>Coffee <strike> addict</strike> person </li>
				</ul>
				
				
				<p>
					And this is what I can remember at 12:30 am.

				</p>
				
				<p><h2>However, </h2>
					
					The one thing I spend my time on near constantly, is on thinking about how online communities, their health and understanding them.

				<p>	Yes yes, this is a personal website, and of course there has to be one of those really great tag lines. </p>				

				
				<p>
					In this case, its true. I have a mid 5 digit slashdot account number somewhere. As a teen I found stories about Eternal September to be fascinating, the first theft in a video game, the outrage in the WoW Shaman Forums.
				</p>
				<p> More pertinently, I've been:
					<ul> 
						<li>Forum admin </li>
						<li>Reddit mod (2003 - 2018 active)</li>
						<li>Reddit LIA (2022)</li>
					</ul>	
				</p>

			I turned my MBA disseration into a chance to study the impact of community rule changes on user behavior.

			I wouldnt be happy if I wasnt working on it.

				<h4>It's what I think about, all the time.</h4>

				<p>
					We live in an era of unprecedented data and computationally
					power. We have the data and ability to understand how the
					ideas that move us, move through us.
				</p>
				<p>
					Yet, there are far too many times that mod teams work in the
					dark, never knowing how their actions impacted their
					communities.
				</p>

				<p>
					This question plagued me enough, that I retiurned to code,
					got my data science creds, and then used my MBA dissertation
					to take a data-driven look at how subreddit behavior was
					impacted by rule changes.
				</p>

				<p>
					It's why I work at Genpact in their Trust and Safety
					sdivision.
				</p>

				<p>
					The core topic I am working towards is bridging the language
					resource gap.
				</p>

				<p>
					The reason I work with Gen AI is to understand and apply it
					effectively. This site wouldn't exist if it weren't for the
					accelerated learning that it enabled. Side note - don't try
					and write code from scratch.
				</p>

				<p>I want to make things better.</p>
				<p>I want to do it correctly.</p>
				<p>I want to do it effectively.</p>

				<p>
					My background allows me to talk to almost everyone (family
					disagrees, but let's just ignore them).
				</p>

				<p>
					If this is what you think about, I'd love to talk to you and
					hear your thoughts.
				</p>
